# luckyporter.py
This script can send files to a Remote server using the Port Forwarding. We have used the Pyngrok and some other modules. 
Run this command before using this file:
```
pip3 install -r requirement.txt
```
### Actions - send, receive

Send - let you send multiple files at the same time to a remote server even if you have dynamic IP. Useful when you have Cloud Service and you want to share a file from your Local PC to the Cloud machine.

Receive - let you receive any file from a remote Server with three different options. ( Netcat, Wget, Curl )

I Will keep updating the script.
